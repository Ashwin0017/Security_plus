Four control categories

Security controls are grouped into four broad categories that describe how they are implemented. Each example control in the video is mapped into one of these categories.



**Technical**: Technology-based controls such as OS configurations, firewalls, antivirus, and log collection systems.



**Managerial**: Policies, procedures, and documentation such as onboarding policies, security policies, and compliance rules.



**Operational**: People-driven activities such as security guards, awareness training, patrols, and manual log reviews.



**Physical**: Tangible mechanisms that restrict physical access such as locks, fences, badge readers, warning signs, and fire extinguishers.



**Preventive** **controls**

Preventive controls are designed to stop or limit access to resources before an incident occurs.



Examples: Firewall rules blocking traffic, guard shack checking IDs, and door locks preventing entry.



Mappings: Firewall rules → technical; onboarding access policies → managerial; guard shack checks → operational; door locks → physical.



**Deterrent, detective, and corrective**

The video distinguishes controls that discourage attackers, detect incidents, and fix issues after detection.



**Deterrent**: Makes attackers think twice, e.g., security splash screens, threat of demotion, reception desks, warning signs (technical, managerial, operational, physical respectively).



**Detective**: Identifies or alerts on incidents, e.g., system log collection, login report review, security patrols, motion detectors (technical, managerial, operational, physical).



**Corrective**: Acts after an incident to reduce impact or restore service, e.g., restoring from backups, incident reporting policies, contacting law enforcement, using a fire extinguisher (technical, managerial, operational, physical).



**Compensating and directive controls**

The video then covers controls used when primary controls are missing or when users must be guided to behave securely.



**Compensating**: Alternative or temporary measures, such as firewall rules around vulnerable apps, separation of duties, multiple security staff on shift, or a generator during a power outage.



**Directive**: Weak by themselves but tell people what they should do, such as policies on storing sensitive data in encrypted folders, compliance procedures, security training sessions, and “authorized personnel only” signs.





Key exam takeaways

The instructor emphasizes that examples can often fit more than one type or category, and that real environments may use different combinations of controls. Security professionals should be able to classify a given control both by type (preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, directive) and by category (technical, managerial, operational, physical), and understand that new controls and mappings can emerge as technology changes.







**Identification**: The individual makes a claim about their identity without presenting proof.

**Authentication**: The individual proves their identity, such as showing a driver's license.

**Authorization**: The system checks if the individual is allowed to access the resource.

**AAA Process**: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting are crucial for tracking and managing access.

**Digital** **Application**: In digital systems, identification is often done with usernames, authentication with passwords, and authorization with access control lists.

**Accounting :** Track of all the activity.
